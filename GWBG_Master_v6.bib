	abstract = {We present some accurate and efficient computations of large scale structure observables, obtained with a modified version of the {CLASS} code which is made publicly available. This code includes all relativistic corrections and computes both the power spectrum Cl(z1,z2) and the corresponding correlation function xi(theta,z1,z2) in linear perturbation theory. For Gaussian initial perturbations, these quantities contain the full information encoded in the large scale matter distribution at the level of linear perturbation theory. We illustrate the usefulness of our code for cosmological parameter estimation through a few simple examples.},

	abstract = {One of the main pillars of the \{{\textbackslash}{textbackslashLambda}\}{CDM} model is the Cosmological Principle, which states that our Universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large scales. Here we test this hypothesis using the Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background ({AGWB}) expected to be measured by the Einstein Telescope-Cosmic Explorer network; in particular we perform a numerical computation of the {AGWB} dipole, evaluating the intrinsic contribution due to clustering and the kinematic effect induced by the observer motion. We apply a component separation technique in the {GW} context to disentangle the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic dipole and the shot noise ({SN}), based on the observation of the {AGWB} at different frequencies. We show how this technique can also be implemented in matched-filtering to minimize the covariance which accounts for both instrumental noise and {SN}. Since {GW} detectors are essentially full-sky, we expect that this powerful tool can help in testing the isotropy of our Universe in the next future.},

	abstract = {We present a method to flexibly and self-consistently determine individual galaxies' star formation rates ({SFRs}) from their host haloes' potential well depths, assembly histories, and redshifts. The method is constrained by galaxies' observed stellar mass functions, {SFRs} (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, {UV} luminosity functions, {UV}-{SM} relations, {IRX}-{UV} relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0{\textbackslash}textlessz{\textbackslash}textless10. Key findings include: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching at z{\textbackslash}textgreater1 correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies' star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z{\textbackslash}textless0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching timescales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar mass-halo mass ratios at early times; and, nonetheless, stellar mass-halo mass ratios rise at z{\textbackslash}textgreater5. Also presented are revised stellar mass-halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy {SSFR}; quenched fractions and quenching timescale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities. The public data release ({DR}1) includes the massively parallel ({\textbackslash}textgreater10ˆ5 cores) implementation (the {UniverseMachine}), the newly compiled and remeasured observational data, derived galaxy formation constraints, and mock catalogues including lightcones.},

These waveforms will allow us to detect a larger parameter space of {BBH} coalescence, including a considerable fraction of precessing binaries in the comparable-mass regime, thus significantly improving the expected detection rates.},

	abstract = {We extend the general relativistic description of galaxy clustering developed in Yoo, Fitzpatrick, and Zaldarriaga (2009). For the first time we provide a fully general relativistic description of the observed matter power spectrum and the observed galaxy power spectrum with the linear bias ansatz. It is significantly different from the standard Newtonian description on large scales and especially its measurements on large scales can be misinterpreted as the detection of the primordial non-Gaussianity even in the absence thereof. The key difference in the observed galaxy power spectrum arises from the real-space matter fluctuation defined as the matter fluctuation at the hypersurface of the observed redshift. As opposed to the standard description, the shape of the observed galaxy power spectrum evolves in redshift, providing additional cosmological information. While the systematic errors in the standard Newtonian description are negligible in the current galaxy surveys at low redshift, correct general relativistic description is essential for understanding the galaxy power spectrum measurements on large scales in future surveys with redshift depth z{\textbackslash}textgreater3. We discuss ways to improve the detection significance in the current galaxy surveys and comment on applications of our general relativistic formalism in future surveys.},

Our calculations are done within linear perturbation theory for both the metric and the observer velocities but they can be used for non-linear matter power spectra. We shall see that the complications due to the fact that we only observe on our background lightcone and that we do not truly know the distance of the observed galaxy, but only its redshift is not only an additional difficulty, but even more a new opportunity for future galaxy surveys.},

Given that gravitational wave maps contain a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information, interpreting this signal requires a non-trivial multidisciplinary approach. In this work we present the complete computation of the signal produced by compact object mergers accounting for a detailed modelling of the astrophysical sources and for cosmological perturbations. We develop the {CLASS}\_GWB code, which allows for the computation of the anisotropies of the astrophysical gravitational wave background, accounting for source and detector properties, as well as effects of gravitational wave propagation. We apply our numerical tools to robustly compute the angular power spectrum of the anisotropies of the gravitational wave background generated by astrophysical sources in the {LIGO}-Virgo frequency band. The end-to-end theoretical framework we present can be easily applied to different sources and detectors in other frequency bands. Moreover, the same numerical tools can be used to compute the anisotropies of gravitational wave maps of the sky made using resolved events.},

            A stochastic background of gravitational waves could be created by the superposition of a large number of independent sources. The physical processes occurring at the earliest moments of the universe certainly created a stochastic background that exists, at some level, today. This is analogous to the cosmic microwave background, which is an electromagnetic record of the early universe. The recent observations of gravitational waves by the Advanced {LIGO} and Advanced Virgo detectors imply that there is also a stochastic background that has been created by binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers over the history of the universe. Whether the stochastic background is observed directly, or upper limits placed on it in specific frequency bands, important astrophysical and cosmological statements about it can be made. This review will summarize the current state of research of the stochastic background, from the sources of these gravitational waves to the current methods used to observe them.},

Answering this question will have profound implications for our understanding of the Universe, including the nature of dark matter, the early Universe and stellar evolution. We build on the idea that the clustering properties of merging binary black holes can provide information about binary formation mechanisms and origin. The cross-correlation of galaxy with gravitational wave catalogues carries information about whether black hole mergers trace more closely the distribution of dark matter -- indicative of primordial origin -- or that of stars harboured in luminous and massive galaxies -- indicative of a stellar origin. We forecast the detectability of such signal for several forthcoming and future gravitational wave interferometers and galaxy surveys, including, for the first time in such analyses, an accurate modelling for the different merger rates, lensing magnification and other general relativistic effects. Our results show that forthcoming experiments could allow us to test most of the parameter space of the still viable models investigated, and shed more light on the issue of binary black hole origin and evolution.},

	abstract = {The detection and characterization of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background ({SGWB}) is one of the main goals of Gravitational Wave ({GW}) experiments. The observed {SGWB} will be the combination of {GWs} from cosmological (as predicted by many models describing the physics of the early Universe) and astrophysical origins, which will arise from the superposition of {GWs} from unresolved sources whose signal is too faint to be detected. Therefore, it is important to have a proper modeling of the astrophysical {SGWB} ({ASGWB}) in order to disentangle the two signals; moreover, this will provide additional information on astrophysical properties of compact objects. Applying the Cosmic Rulers formalism, we compute the observed {ASGWB} angular power spectrum, hence using gauge invariant quantities, accounting for all effects intervening between the source and the observer. These are the so-called projection effects, which include Kaiser, Doppler and gravitational potentials effect. Our results show that these projection effects are the most important at the largest scales, and they contribute to up to tens of percent of the angular power spectrum amplitude, with the Kaiser term being the largest at all scales. While the exact impact of these results will depend on instrumental and astrophysical details, a precise theoretical modeling of the {ASGWB} will necessarily need to include all these projection effects.},

	abstract = {We report the construction of a three-dimensional template bank for the search for gravitational waves from inspiralling binaries consisting of spinning compact objects. The parameter space consists of two dimensions describing the mass parameters and one "reduced-spin" parameter, which describes the secular (non-precessing) spin effects in the waveform. The template placement is based on an efficient stochastic algorithm and makes use of the semi-analytical computation of a metric in the parameter space. We demonstrate that for "low-mass" (\$m\_1 + m\_2 {\textbackslash}lesssim 12{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) binaries, this template bank achieves effective fitting factors \${\textbackslash}sim0.92\$--\$0.99\$ towards signals from generic spinning binaries in the advanced detector era over the entire parameter space of interest (including binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and black hole-neutron star binaries). This provides a powerful and viable method for searching for gravitational waves from generic spinning low-mass compact binaries. Under the assumption that spin magnitudes of black-holes [neutron-stars] are uniformly distributed between 0--0.98 [0 -- 0.4] and spin angles are isotropically distributed, the expected improvement in the average detection volume (at a fixed signal-to-noise-ratio threshold) of a search using this reduced-spin bank is \${\textbackslash}sim20-52{\textbackslash}\%\$, as compared to a search using a non-spinning bank.},

	abstract = {Gravitational waveforms from the inspiral and ring-down stages of the binary black hole coalescences can be modelled accurately by approximation/perturbation techniques in general relativity. Recent progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model also the non-perturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence problem. This enables us to {\textbackslash}emph\{coherently\} search for all three stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes using a single template bank. Taking our motivation from these results, we propose a family of template waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and ring-down stages of the coalescence of non-spinning binary black holes that follow quasi-circular inspiral. This two-dimensional template family is explicitly parametrized by the physical parameters of the binary. We show that the template family is not only {\textbackslash}emph\{effectual\} in detecting the signals from black hole coalescences, but also {\textbackslash}emph\{faithful\} in estimating the parameters of the binary. We compare the sensitivity of a search (in the context of different ground-based interferometers) using all three stages of the black hole coalescence with other template-based searches which look for individual stages separately. We find that the proposed search is significantly more sensitive than other template-based searches for a substantial mass-range, potentially bringing about remarkable improvement in the event-rate of ground-based interferometers. As part of this work, we also prescribe a general procedure to construct interpolated template banks using non-spinning black hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity.},

	shorttitle = {Beware of commonly used approximations I},
	abstract = {In the era of precision cosmology, establishing the correct magnitude of statistical errors in cosmological parameters is of crucial importance. However, widely used approximations in galaxy surveys analyses can lead to parameter uncertainties that are grossly mis-estimated, even in a regime where the theory is well understood (e.g., linear scales). These approximations can be introduced at three different levels: in the form of the likelihood, in the theoretical modelling of the observable and in the numerical computation of the observable. Their consequences are important both in data analysis through e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter inference, and when survey instrument and strategy are designed and their constraining power on cosmological parameters is forecasted, for instance using Fisher matrix analyses. In this work, considering the galaxy angular power spectrum as the target observable, we report one example of approximation for each of such three categories: neglecting off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, neglecting cosmic magnification and using the Limber approximation on large scales. We show that these commonly used approximations affect the robustness of the analysis and lead, perhaps counter-intuitively, to unacceptably large mis-estimates of parameters errors (from few{\textasciitilde}\$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ up to few{\textasciitilde}\$100{\textbackslash}\%\$) and correlations. Furthermore, these approximations might even spoil the benefits of the nascent multi-tracer and multi-messenger cosmology. Hence we recommend that the type of analysis presented here should be repeated for every approximation adopted in survey design or data analysis, to quantify how it may affect the results. To this aim, we have developed {\textbackslash}texttt\{Multi{\textbackslash}\_CLASS\}, a new extension of {\textbackslash}texttt\{{CLASS}\} that includes the angular power spectrum for multiple (galaxy and other tracers such as gravitational waves) populations.},

As statistical errors shrink, the required control over systematic errors increases. Therefore, models or approximations that were sufficiently accurate so far, may introduce significant systematic biases in the parameter best-fit values and jeopardize the robustness of cosmological analyses. We present a general expression to estimate a priori the systematic error introduced in parameter inference due to the use of insufficiently good approximations in the computation of the observable of interest or the assumption of an incorrect underlying model. Although this methodology can be applied to measurements of any scientific field, we illustrate its power by studying the effect of modeling the angular galaxy power spectrum incorrectly. We also introduce Multi\_CLASS, a new, public modification of the Boltzmann code {CLASS}, which includes the possibility to compute angular cross-power spectra for two different tracers. We find that significant biases in most of the cosmological parameters are introduced if one assumes the Limber approximation or neglects lensing magnification in modern galaxy survey analyses, and the effect is in general larger for the multi-tracer case, especially for the parameter controlling primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {NL}\}\$.},

We give the corresponding linear result for a magnitude-limited survey at low redshift, and discuss the angular power spectrum of the total count distribution. We also calculate the cross-correlation with the {CMB} polarization and temperature including Doppler source terms, magnification, redshift distortions and other velocity effects for the sources, and discuss why the contribution of redshift distortions is generally small.

Furthermore, the extent to which the subtraction of bright (loud) mergers gaussianizes the resulting confusion noise of unresolved sources is illustrated.

Full exploitation of this window can especially be provided by combining data coming from gravitational waves experiments with luminous tracers of the Large Scale Structure, like galaxies. In this work we investigate the cross-correlation signal between gravitational waves resolved events, as detected by the Einstein Telescope, and actively star-forming galaxies. The galaxies distribution is computed through their {UV} and {IR} luminosity functions and the gravitational waves events, assumed to be of stellar origin, are self-consistently computed from the aforementioned galaxies distribution. We provide a state-of-the-art treatment both on the astrophysical side, taking into account the impact of the star formation and chemical evolution histories of galaxies, and in computing the cross-correlation signal, for which we include lensing and relativistic effects. We find that the measured cross-correlation signal can be sufficiently strong to overcome the noise and provide a clear signal. As a possible application of this methodology, we consider a proof-of-concept case in which we aim at discriminating a metallicity dependence on the compact objects merger efficiency against a reference case with no metallicity dependence. When considering galaxies with a Star Formation Rate \${\textbackslash}psi {\textgreater} 10 {\textbackslash}: M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} /{\textbackslash}rm\{yr\}\$, a Signal-to-Noise ratio around a value of 2-4 is gained after a decade of observation time, depending on the observed fraction of the sky.

We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm ({FOF}), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msol/h {\textless} M {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} Msol/h, to {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5\%.

In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20\%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by {\textasciitilde}20-50\%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

	abstract = {Gravitational wave detectors are starting to reveal the redshift evolution of the binary black hole ({BBH}) merger rate, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$. We make predictions for \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$ as a function of black hole mass for systems originating from isolated binaries. To this end, we investigate correlations between the delay time and black hole mass by means of the suite of binary population synthesis simulations, {COMPAS}. We distinguish two channels: the common envelope ({CE}), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow ({RLOF}) channel, characterised by whether the system has experienced a common envelope or not. We find that the {CE} channel preferentially produces {BHs} with masses below about \$30{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and short delay times (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm delay\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$Gyr), while the stable {RLOF} channel primarily forms systems with {BH} masses above \$30{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and long delay times (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm delay\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$Gyr). We provide a new fit for the metallicity specific star-formation rate density based on the Illustris {TNG} simulations, and use this to convert the delay time distributions into a prediction of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$. This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$ for high and low primary {BH} masses. We furthermore find that, at high redshift, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$ is dominated by the {CE} channel, while at low redshift it contains a large contribution (\${\textbackslash}sim 40{\textbackslash}\%\$) from the stable {RLOF} channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts, {BBHs} with component masses above \$30{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ will become increasingly scarce relative to less massive {BBH} systems. Evidence of this distinct evolution of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{BBH}\}\}(z)\$ for different {BH} masses can be tested with future detectors.},

The modified conservation laws for energy and momentum keeping track of the gravitational-wave flux are presented. The theory is applied to two-body systems in bound and scattering states subject to newtonian gravity generalized to include a 1/r3 force allowing for orbital precession. The evolution of the orbits is studied in the adiabatic approximation. From these results I derive the conditions for capture of two bodies to form a bound state by the emission of gravitational radiation.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15-year pulsar-timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law-spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law-spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for these latter Bayes factors using a method that removes inter-pulsar correlations from our data set, finding \$p = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ (approx. \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of inter-pulsar correlations yields \$p = 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} - 1.9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ (approx. \$3.5 - 4{\textbackslash}sigma\$). Assuming a fiducial \$f{\textasciicircum}\{-2/3\}\$ characteristic-strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black-hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\_\{-0.6\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1/(1 yr). The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black-hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

Stated in this way, the background is entirely independent of the cosmology, and only weakly dependent on the evolutionary history of the sources. This relationship allows one easily to compute the amplitude and spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave backgrounds from a broad range of astrophysical sources, and to evaluate the uncertainties therein.},

The newly released code {CLASS} (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) incorporates improved approximation schemes leading to a simultaneous gain in speed and precision. We describe here the three approximations used by {CLASS} for basic {LambdaCDM} models, namely: a baryon-photon tight-coupling approximation which can be set to first order, second order or to a compromise between the two; an ultra-relativistic fluid approximation which had not been implemented in public distributions before; and finally a radiation streaming approximation taking reionisation into account.},

	abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

We base our analysis on an empirical approach to galactic astrophysics that allows to follow the evolution of individual systems. We then characterize the energy density of the {SGWB} as a tracer of the total matter density, in order to compute the angular power spectrum of anisotropies with the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System ({CLASS}) public code in full generality. We obtain predictions for the isotropic energy density and for the angular power spectrum of the {SGWB} anisotropies, and study the prospect for their observations with advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave and Virgo Observatories and with the Einstein Telescope. We identify the contributions coming from different type of sources (binary black holes, binary neutron stars and black hole-neutron star) and from different redshifts. We examine in detail the spectral shape of the energy density for all types of sources, comparing the results for the two detectors. We find that the power spectrum of the {SGWB} anisotropies behaves like a power law on large angular scales and drops at small scales: we explain this behaviour in terms of the redshift distribution of sources that contribute most to the signal, and of the sensitivities of the two detectors. Finally, we simulate a high resolution full sky map of the {SGWB} starting from the power spectra obtained with {CLASS} and including Poisson statistics and clustering properties.},
