Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Dr. Philipp Mertsch and Prof. Dr. Julien Lesgourgues. Lorenzo Valbusa Dall'Armi also offered his expertise on gravitational waves as well as on the used formalism and he kindly provided some of his data to compare with my code. Additionally, Sefa Pamuk, Tobias Thrien and Christian Radermacher were always happy to discuss physical concepts with me and provide help regarding the CLASS code. Laurin SÃ¶ding helped me with some concerns regarding the NIFTy code which was very useful. Special thanks also to Julia, Nikolas, Sefa, Tobias, Clemens, Nikhil, Ankit and my parents for proofreading. 

Lastly, I want to thank my parents for always supporting me and all the other Master students for the nice discussions and the good time throughout this year.
