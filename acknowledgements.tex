I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Dr. Philipp Mertsch and Prof. Dr. Julien Lesgourgues. Lorenzo Valbusa Dall'Armi also offered his expertise on gravitational waves and kindly provided some of his data to compare with my code. Additionally, Sefa Pamuk, Tobias Thrien and Christian Radermacher were always happy to discuss physical concepts and provide help regarding the CLASS code. Laurin SÃ¶ding helped me with some concerns regarding the NIFTy code, which was very useful. Thanks to Clemens Panitz and Sefa Pamuk for proofreading this thesis. 

Lastly, I want to thank my parents for supporting me and all the other Master students for the nice discussions and the good time during this year.
