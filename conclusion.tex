We calculated the anisotropies of the AGWB in a frequency-dependent way and used the angular power spectra in an IFT separation with respect to a Gaussian noise at ET+CE levels.

To do that, we considered the stochastic GW background of BBH using the number density distribution from {\tt Multi\_CLASS}. GW can help to test the cosmological principle since they have better sky coverage than other large scale structure surveys. For frequencies up to $\approx 1000$ Hertz, mergers containing neutron stars are negligible compared to BBH, which is why we only consider BBH in this formalism.
The {\tt Multi\_CLASS} code was modified to compute the frequency-dependent angular power spectra of the AGWB. The frequency dependence comes from the window function which weights projection effects at different redshifts. These projection effects stem from the line of sight integration and include redshift space distortions, density fluctuations, the Doppler and further general relativity effects. 

The window function depends on the BBH merger rate and the energy spectrum of one GW. We consider all three phases of binary coalescence, i.e. inspiral, merger and ringdown. For the merger rate, we model the SFR since BH come from stellar evolution. We also parametrise the HMF because stars form in haloes. Then, we can integrate over the halo mass to arrive at the merger rate. 
A further frequency dependence comes from the evolution bias, also calculated from the merger rate and the energy spectrum. However, this is negligible in the final power spectrum.
We model the noise from design sensitivities of ET+CE using scale-independent Gaussian noise as an approximation.

Afterwards, we use the resulting anisotropies for an IFT separation with the {\tt NIFTy} package. The separation does not work for a lower angular power spectrum at 100 Hertz but works roughly for a higher one at 400 Hertz.
To test the same method with the cosmological GW background, we use {\tt GW\_CLASS} assuming an inflationary background at 900 Hertz. Since this background is below the astrophysical one, the reconstruction is not possible.


Apart from the instrumental noise, the kinematic dipole and statistical shot noise also obscure the intrinsic AGWB. In the future, those can be modelled using the same formalism and can then be included in the IFT separation. The instrumental noise can also be modelled in a scale-dependent way to be more realistic, i.e. increasing at higher multipoles. 

Furthermore, astrophysical parameters, like the mass of each merging BH and the inclination angle, could be drawn from a physical probability distribution.

Computing one angular power spectrum at a frequency is still computationally costly at the moment. Improving the speed of the implementation would also allow computing more frequencies to see the full frequency dependence. It would then be interesting to use the functional frequency dependence directly in {\tt NIFTy}. This should improve the separation since it is an extra dimension that can be used to perform the separation. 
The next step would then be separating the AGWB from the cosmological one, either without or in the presence of instrumental noise.
