We compute the angular power spectra of the AGWB using {\tt Multi\_CLASS} with a dependence on the measured frequency. We then use this result for an IFT separation with the NIFTy package. 

For the noise power spectrum, we optimistically assume Gaussian noise. This could be made more realistic by using the ET spectrum directly for the separation. 

In the future, it would be natural to extend this and use the frequency dependence directly in NIFTy. This should improve the separation since it is an extra dimension that can be used to perform the separation.
