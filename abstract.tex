Apart from single gravitational wave (GW) events, those with a smaller amplitude produce a stochastic GW background. This has not been measured yet using traditional GW detectors, like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo or the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA). With future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope (ET) or Cosmic Explorer (CE), it is expected to be observed in the frequency range of $\approx 10-10^4$ Hz.  The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is modelled here in a frequency-dependent way using the {\tt MultiCLASS} code. Then, we use Information Field Theory (IFT) to separate it from Gaussian instrumental noise in harmonic space as a proof of concept.
