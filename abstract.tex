Unresolved gravitational waves (GW) contribute to a stochastic GW background. This has not been measured yet using traditional GW detectors, like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo or the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA). With future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope (ET) or Cosmic Explorer (CE), the background is expected to be observed in the frequency range of about $ 10-10^3$ Hz. Its main contribution is expected to be of astrophysical origin. In this work, we will model the astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) in a frequency-dependent way using an extension of the {\tt Multi\_CLASS} code. Through modification of this code, we compute angular power spectra of the AGWB that depend on frequency. We then assume the design noise of the cross-correlation between ET and CE to check whether the AGWB will be detectable. To achieve this, we use Information Field Theory (IFT) to separate our calculated power spectra from the design noise. The same method is also applied to the cosmological GW background. We find that it is possible to partly reconstruct the relatively high AGWB power spectrum at 400 Hz. However, even though future detectors are forecast to measure a large portion of GW events, we find that they will not be able to measure the AGWB at all frequencies or measure the cosmological background.
