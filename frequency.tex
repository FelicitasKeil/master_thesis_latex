The AGWB is not independent of the observed frequency of the GW. In the standard {\tt Multi\_CLASS} code, it is possible to compute the angular power spectrum of the AGWB. However, this does not include any frequency dependency of this background which can generally not be neglected. 

Therefore we added this frequency dependence which enters in two instances here. One is the frequency-dependent window function that weights contributions from different redshifts and the second is the evolution bias which accounts for new sources being added with time (i.e. lower z). Both will be discussed in Section \ref{window_fct_section} and \ref{evo_bias_section}.

To summarise in advance, the window function weights different redshift regions of the projection effects from Section \ref{projection_effects} according to the source distribution.

\begin{equation}
    \delta_{AGWB}(f_o, \hat{n})=\int dz \tilde{W}(f_0, z)\Delta_{AGWB}(f_0, \hat{n}, z)
\end{equation}

We need to specify the GW frequency as a parameter in the initialisation file that we give to {\tt CLASS}, so we implemented it as a new input parameter for {\tt Multi\_CLASS}.

The frequency dependence of the window function is only present if we consider not only the inspiral phase but also the merger and ringdown phases. For the inspiral phase, we would have the following energy spectrum.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dE_{GW}}{df_e d\Omega_e} \propto f_0^{-\frac{1}{3}}(1+z)^{-\frac{1}{3}} .
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}\propto f_0^{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{equation}
Considering only the inspiral phase would then make the window function frequency independent.
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{W}(z)\propto \frac{f_0(d E_{GW}/df_e d\Omega_e)}{\bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}(f_0)} = const.
\end{equation}

For that reason, it is necessary to consider all three phases of the merger which we will see in the energy spectrum, see also Fig. \ref{IMR_figure}. Since the window function depends on the rate of BBH mergers and on the energy spectrum of one individual merger, we need to model these two components. How this is realised in the code can be seen on the call graph in the Appendix \ref{call_graph}.

Section \ref{energy_spectrum_section} and \ref{merger_rate_section} discuss the frequency dependence of the energy spectrum and the merger rate, respectively. For the merger rate, we need to model the star formation rate (SFR) and the halo mass function (HMF) which is done in Sections \ref{sfr_section} and \ref{hmf_section}. The resulting window function is shown in Section \ref{window_fct_section}. GW biases are treated in Sections \ref{bias_section} and \ref{evo_bias_section}.

\section{Energy Spectrum}
\label{energy_spectrum_section}

For the modelling of all three phases of the binary coalescence we use the waveform by \cite{ajith_inspiral-merger-ringdown_2011}. The phases are inspiral, merger and ringdown, as shown schematically in Fig. \ref{IMR_figure}. They arrive at this expression using post-Newtonian corrections to more standard waveforms. This is done in geometric units, i.e. $G=c=1$.

\[ A(f) = C f_1^{-7/6} \begin{cases}
        f'^{-7/6}(1+ \sum_{i=2}^3\alpha_i v^i) & f<f_1 \\
        \omega_m f'^{-2/3}(1+ \sum_{i=1}^2 \epsilon_i v^i) & f_1 \leq f < f_2 \\
        \omega_r \mathcal{L}(f, f_2, \sigma) & f_2 \leq f < f_3
\end{cases}
\]

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Images/IMR_figure.png}
    \caption{The three phases of a binary coalescence: inspiral, merger and ringdown.}
    \label{IMR_figure}
\end{figure} 

Note that this is the amplitude as a function of the frequency, so a Fourier transform of $A(t)$.
Here, $f'$ is a frequency ratio using the first transition frequency, see below. 

\begin{equation}
    f'=\frac{f}{f_1}
\end{equation}

The parameter $\nu$ is dimensionless since we are working in geometric units.

\begin{equation}
    \nu=(\pi M f)^{1/3}
\end{equation}

The parameters $\omega_m$ and $\omega_r$ are used to make the function continuous and thus are dependent on the total mass $M=m_1+m_2$. The parameters $\alpha_i$ are post-Newtonian corrections. They are calculated using general relativity and their values are shown in Table \ref{amplitude_param} along with the values for $\epsilon_i$. Depending on the symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ and the spin parameter $\chi$, they take different values. The values are given with and without the zero-spin approximation which is used in this work.

\begin{equation}
    \eta=\frac{m_1 m_2}{M^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \chi = (1+\delta)\frac{\chi_1}{2} + (1-\delta)\frac{\chi_2}{2}
\end{equation}

Here, $\delta$ is the mass difference and $\chi_i$ depends on the spin angular momentum $S_i$ of the \textit{i}th BH.

\begin{equation}
    \delta=\frac{m_1-m_2}{M}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \chi_i=\frac{S_i}{m_i^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c | c}
            Parameter & $\alpha_2$ & $\alpha_3$ & $\epsilon_1$ & $\epsilon_2$ \\

        \label{amplitude_param}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The frequency $f_1$ at the transition of the inspiral and merger phase is the last stable orbit of the binary. Once the merger phase has started the orbits cease to be stable since the objects start to fall in. This corresponds to a maximum of the effective potential. The frequency was calculated by \cite{bardeen_rotating_1972}.

\begin{equation}
    f_1 = \frac{c^3}{6^{3/2}2\pi M G}
\end{equation}

The transition frequency from merger to ringdown is given by the least-damped mode [\cite{maggiore_gravitational_2008}] which is also the dominant quasi-normal mode. This is part of the description of the BBH system as characterised by $n$ normal modes with frequencies $\omega_n$, discussed further in chapter 12.3 of the same book.

\begin{equation}
    f_2 \approx 0.747 \frac{c}{2\pi R_S} \approx 12 \rm{kHz} \left( \frac{M_\odot}{M}\right)
\end{equation}

For the ringdown, we have a Lorentzian function $\mathcal{L}$ centred around the merger to ringdown transition frequency $f_2$ with the width $\sigma$.

The global normalisation factor $C$ has the following form in SI units.

\begin{equation}
    C = \sqrt{\frac{5}{24}}\frac{(GM_c)^{5/6}}{\pi^{2/3}c^{3/2}}\frac{(1+z)^2}{d_L}
\end{equation}

This depends on the chirp mass which characterises a waveform instead of the total mass and the luminosity distance.

\begin{equation}
    M_c = \frac{(m_1m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/5}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    d_L = a_0 (1+z)\int_0^z d\tilde{z}\frac{c}{a_0 H(\tilde{z})}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/dE_df_of_f.png}
    \caption{The energy spectrum as a function of the observed frequency for a BBH merger where both BH have a mass of 20$M_\odot\ $ at $z=0$. }
    \label{dE_df_f}
\end{figure} 

The strain is directly given by the amplitude and a phase $\psi(f)$.


\begin{equation}
    h(f)=A(f)e^{-i\psi(f)}
\end{equation}

Later, we will consider the square strain as a function of frequency $|h(f)|^2=|A(f)|^2$ for the energy spectrum, so we can omit the phase $\psi(f)$. Here, the redshift dependence will enter later through the derivation by the emission frequency. From this waveform template, we can get the energy spectrum in the following way.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dE_{GW,e}}{df_e d\Omega_e} = \frac{\pi d_L^2 c^3f_o^2}{2G(1+z)^2} | h(f_o)| ^2 \propto f_o^2h^2(f_o) \propto h^2(t)
\end{equation}

    \label{dE_df_diff_frequencies}
\end{figure}

We show the energy spectrum as a function of $z$ for different frequencies, see Fig. \ref{dE_df_diff_frequencies}, again for two BH with a mass of $20 M_\odot$ each. We can see different sections of Fig. \ref{dE_df_f} here. This is because $d E_{GW,e}/df_e d\Omega_e$ only depends on z through the emitted frequency. The energy spectrum is written as a function of $f_e$, but we implement it in such a way that the user can choose the received frequency at the detector.

\begin{equation}
    f_e = (1+z)f_0
\end{equation}

At lower frequencies, like 1 Hz, the energy spectrum consists of the inspiral phase. At 10 Hz, we can see the transition from the inspiral to the merger phase. The transitions are not always smooth since the parameters $\omega_i$ fix the continuity of the curve but not the slope. The transition to the ringdown is visible at 100 Hz. At high frequencies such as 1000 Hz, the ringdown phase dominates at all redshifts.

The BH masses follow a probability distribution over which we would need to integrate separately. However, to speed up the calculation in our code, we assume $m_1 = m_2 = 20M_\odot$. This is a common BH mass considering GW observations from LVK [\cite{the_ligo_scientific_collaboration_population_2022}.]



\section{Halo Mass Function}
\label{hmf_section}
The merger rate of BBH depends on the number of haloes since their formation takes place in haloes. This is why it depends on the HMF $\frac{dn}{dM_h}(z_f, M_h)$ integrated over the halo mass. 
\begin{equation}
    R_{BBH}(z) \propto \int dM_h \frac{dn}{dM_h}(z_f, M_h)\langle SFR(M_h, z_f)\rangle_{SF}
\end{equation}

The HMF is the comoving number density of haloes with masses between $M$ and $M+dM$. We first consider the variance of the matter density field $\sigma^2$ which we get from the linear matter power spectrum integrated over the wavenumber $k$ with a window function. This is the Fourier transform of a tophat function in real space with the width $R$, corresponding to the radius of the spherical halo. Physically, overfull regions in the universe gravitationally attract and form haloes.

\begin{equation}
    \sigma^2(R, z) = \int_0^\infty k^2 P_{lin}(k, z) W^2(k, R) dk
\end{equation}

For a spherical halo model, we get the radius through the mass and the density.

\begin{equation}
    R= \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho_m}}
\end{equation}

In the so-called peak-background-split formalism, the HMF comes from the logarithmic derivative of $\sigma^{-1}$ by the halo mass.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dn(M)}{dM }=\frac{\rho_m}{M^2}\frac{d\ln (\frac{1}{\sigma})}{d\ln M}f_{NL}(\sigma)
\end{equation}



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth, clip]{Images/HMF_diff_z.png}
    \caption{The dimensionless HMF for different redshifts $z$ at $\Delta=800$.}
    \label{HMF_z}
\end{figure} 


The factor $f_{NL}$ accounts for non-linear effects in the halo collapse. There are different ways to model these effects. A common analytical one is the Press-Schechter formalism parametrised by the critical overdensity $\delta_c$.

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \frac{\delta \rho}{\bar{\rho}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_{PS}(\sigma)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\delta_c}{\sigma}\exp(-\frac{\delta_c^2}{2\sigma^2})
\end{equation}

Here, we use instead the parametrisation by \cite{tinker_toward_2008}. They use a fitting formula depending on the overdensity $\Delta$. The overdensity characterises how much denser the sphere is compared to the average universe density $\bar{\rho}_m$ at the corresponding redshift.

\begin{equation}
    \Delta = \frac{3M_{\Delta}}{4\pi R^3_{\Delta}\bar{\rho_m}}
\end{equation}




The non-linear corrections then have the following form.

\begin{equation}
    f_{NL}(\sigma)=A \left( \left(\frac{\sigma}{b}\right)^{-a}+1\right)\exp(-\frac{c}{\sigma^2})
\end{equation}


The fitting parameters $A, a, b$ and $c$ functionally depend on the overdensity.

\[ A = \begin{cases}
    0.1(\log_{10}\Delta)-0.05 & \Delta<1600 \\
    0.26 & \Delta \geq 1600
\end{cases}
\]

\begin{equation}
    a=1.43+(\log_{10}\Delta -2.3)^{1.5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    b=1.0+(\log_{10}\Delta -1.6)^{-1.5}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    c=1.2+(\log_{10}\Delta -2.35)^{1.6}
\end{equation}



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \subfloat[{The dimensionless HMF for different overdensity parameters $\Delta$ at $z=0$.}
        \label{HMF_delta}]{
        \includegraphics[width=7.5cm, clip]{Images/HMF_diff_delta.png}}
    \subfloat[The HMF in units of $\frac{h/M_\odot}{(Mpc/h)^3}$ or respectively $\frac{h^4}{M\odot Mpc^3}$ with $\Delta=800$, here at $z=0$.

        \includegraphics[width=7.5cm, clip]{Images/HMF.png}}
    \caption{The HMF at $z=0$.}
\end{figure} 

To show how the redshift influences the dimensionless HMF $M^2/\bar{\rho_M} dn/dM$, we vary the parameter in Fig. \ref{HMF_z}. We can see that there are consistently more haloes at lower $z$. This is consistent with the fact that structures are growing linearly with the scale factor $a$. In Fig. \ref{HMF_delta}, the overdensity parameter $\Delta$ is varied. For higher overdensities, we get a lower HMF since it is rarer for such a high overdensity to exist as a fluctuation. In our implementation, we choose a medium overdensity of $\Delta=800$ and evaluate the HMF at different redshifts and halo masses. The HMF is shown in regular dimensions $\frac{h/M_\odot}{(Mpc/h)^3}$ for $\Delta=800$ and $z=0$ in Fig. \ref{HMF_dim}.


\section{Star Formation Rate}
\label{sfr_section}

The BBH merger rate also depends on the SFR which is the rate at which gas and dust are turned into stars. This is relevant since BH are end products of stellar evolution.

\begin{equation}
    R_{BBH}(z) \propto \int dM_h \frac{dn}{dM_h}(z_f, M_h)\langle SFR(M_h, z_f)\rangle_{SF}
\end{equation}


To model the SFR, we use the \textsc{UniverseMachine} code from \cite{behroozi_universemachine_2019}. They use observational constraints and data from simulations to compute SFR for individual galaxies.

In the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, galaxies form at the centre of haloes. Haloes are gravitationally self-bound structures that contain virialised dark matter. This means that the virial equation applies in this case. Here, $T$ is the potential energy and $U$ is the kinetic energy.

\begin{equation}
    2T=U
\end{equation}

So far, there exists no framework in which we can derive the SFR from first principles. The authors have found that a double power law plus Gaussian is well suited to fit the data. They then determine the best-fit parameters for this functional form. This determines the SFR for every halo at a given redshift. They use weak priors and observational constraints for less bias and the potential to reveal new physics.

To obtain the fit, they use dark matter simulations, here Bolshoi-Planck [\cite{klypin_dark_2011}] and MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) [\cite{klypin_multidark_2016}], which simulate a mock universe. They contain halo merger trees, which can be compared to observations. Behroozi et al. used data from multiple experiments, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) [\cite{abazajian_seventh_2009}] and Ultravista [\cite{mccracken_ultravista_2012}]. The observables include stellar mass functions, UV luminosity functions and galaxy auto-correlation functions.
Using this data, they compute a likelihood and run a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample the SFR range.

Like in \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}, we consider only star-forming galaxies. This omits the fraction of quenched galaxies $f_Q = 1 -f_{SF}$, also modeled in \textsc{UniverseMachine}. The adopted SFR functional form is the following. 

\begin{equation}
    \langle SFR_{SF}(M_{peak}(v_{Mpeak, z}), z)\rangle = \epsilon \left[ \left( v^\alpha + v^\beta \right)^{-1} + \gamma \exp \left(-\frac{\log_{10}(v)^2}{2\delta^2}\right) \right]
\end{equation}

The velocity $v$ is defined as the ratio of the real ($v_{Mpeak})$ and the characteristic velocity ($V$) at the halo peak mass, both in $\rm{km} \;\rm{s}^{-1}$.

\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{v_{Mpeak}}{V \cdot \rm{km} \;\rm{s}^{-1}}
\end{equation}

The fit parameters $V, \epsilon, \alpha, \beta$ and  $\gamma$ depend on the rotational velocity at peak halo mass $v_{Mpeak}$ and on the redshift. The median $v_{Mpeak}$ depends on the halo mass and is taken from the \textit{Bolshoi-Planck} DM simulation as:

\begin{equation}
    v_{Mpeak}(M_h, a) = 200 \frac{km}{s}\left[ \frac{M_h}{M_{200kms}(a)}\right]^3
    \label{v_mpeak-M_h-relation}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    M_{200kms}(a) = \frac{1.64 \cdot 10^{12} M_\odot\ }{(\frac{a}{0.378})^{-0.142}+(\frac{a}{0.378})^{-1.79}} .
\end{equation}

The characteristic SFR  in $M_\odot\ yr^{-1}$ is the global factor $\epsilon$. For the slope of the $SFR-v_{Mpeak}$ relation, we have a faint-end and a massive-end slope parameter $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. This is because $v_{Mpeak} \propto M_h^3$ (\ref{v_mpeak-M_h-relation}), so a higher velocity at the peak mass corresponds to a higher halo mass.
Furthermore, $\gamma$ is the strength and $\delta$ the width of the Gaussian SFR efficiency boost. 



\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Images/sfr_of_v.png}
    \caption[The SFR for star-forming galaxies for different redshifts.]{The SFR for star-forming galaxies for different redshifts. The velocity at the historical peak halo mass corresponds to the standard halo mass, see equation \ref{v_mpeak-M_h-relation}.}
    \label{SFR_of_v}
\end{figure} 

The other parameters, except for $\delta$, scale differently for different redshift regions. For $V$, $\epsilon$ and $\alpha$, the scaling is separated into $z=0$, $z\approx 1-2$, $z=3-7$ and $z>7$. The parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have three scaling regions instead of four, as they are not well constrained at high redshifts. Here, $a$ is the scale factor.

\begin{equation}
    \log_{10}(V) = V_0 + V_a(1-a)+V_{la}ln(1+z)+V_z z
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \log_{10}(\epsilon) = \epsilon_0 + \epsilon_a(1-a)+\epsilon_{la}ln(1+z)+\epsilon_z z
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \alpha_0 + \alpha_a(1-a)+\alpha_{la}ln(1+z)+\alpha_z z
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \beta = \beta_0 + \beta_a(1-a)+\beta_z z
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \log_{10}(\gamma) = \gamma_0 + \gamma_a(1-a)+\gamma_{la}ln(1+z)+\gamma_z z
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \delta = \delta_0
\end{equation}

The SFR with the best-fit parameters from \textsc{UniverseMachine} (not listed here, see \cite{behroozi_universemachine_2019}) is plotted in Fig. \ref{SFR_of_v} as a function of $v_{Mpeak}$ for different redshifts. As a caveat, the SFR at higher redshift is not physical at masses above the peak. In that redshift region, there are no haloes at such high masses present.

\section{Merger Rate}
\label{merger_rate_section}

With the SFR and the HMF, we can now calculate the BBH merger rate by integrating over the halo mass.

\begin{equation}
    R_{BBH}(z)=\mathcal{A}_{LIGO}^{BBH}\int dt_d p(t_d) \int dM_h \frac{dn}{dM_h}(z_f, M_h)\langle SFR(M_h, z_f)\rangle_{SF}
    \label{BBH_merger_equation}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Images/bbh_merger_rate.png}
    \caption{The BBH merger rate as a function of the redshift z.}
    \label{bbh_merger_rate}
\end{figure} 

As mass integration limits, we choose $3\cdot 10^{11} - 4\cdot 10^{12}$ for numerical stability. The merger rate also depends on the time delay distribution $p(t_d)$, where the time delay takes place between the formation and the merger of the binary. 

\begin{equation}
    p(t_d)=\ln\left(\frac{t(z)}{t_{d, min}}\right)\frac{1}{t_d}
\end{equation}

The minimum time delay is 50 Myr, like in \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}. The merger rate is also multiplied by a normalisation factor $\mathcal{A}_{LIGO}^{BBH}$, corresponding to the local merger rate estimated by LIGO and Virgo [\cite{the_ligo_scientific_collaboration_population_2022}].

\begin{equation}
    R_{BBH}(0)=19 \; \frac{1}{\rm{Gpc}^3\rm{yr}}
\end{equation}



Using the results of the last sections, we calculate the BBH merger rate as a function of $z$, shown in Fig. \ref{bbh_merger_rate}.

\section{Window Function}
\label{window_fct_section}

In \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}, we see that the frequency dependence 
of the dipole comes from the evolution bias and the window function. The evolution 
bias accounts for the fact that more sources are created with time. The window 
function is used when we integrate the source functions over the redshift. It weights different redshift regions of the source functions $\Delta_{AGWB}$ from the projection effects in Section \ref{projection_effects} depending on which ones are important for the observable, in this case, GW.


\begin{equation}
    \delta_{AGWB}(f_o, \hat{n}) \equiv \frac{\Omega_{AGWB}(f_o, \hat{n})-\bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}(f_o)}{\bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}(f_o)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    =\int dz \tilde{W}(f_0, z)\Delta_{AGWB}(f_0, \hat{n}, z)
    \label{window_fct_int}
\end{equation}


In the standard version without frequency dependence, we can already see the influence of the different window functions and redshift ranges.

Different window functions are plotted in Fig. \ref{plot_Cl_window_fct}, namely a tophat, a Gaussian and a Dirac window. The window function determines which part of our source function we count for the density contrast. In the case of a Dirac distribution, we count all parts and skip the integration. This is why that window function leads to a higher angular power spectrum.\\
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Images/diff_windows.png}
 \caption{GW angular power spectrum for different window functions.}
 \label{plot_Cl_window_fct}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Images/diff_window_z.png}
 \caption{GW angular power spectrum for different redshifts.}
 \label{plot_Cl_redshift}
\end{figure} 


We can see the GW angular power spectrum for different redshifts in Fig. \ref{plot_Cl_redshift}.
The anisotropies are higher for smaller redshifts. This is due to the fact that we have more GW sources at lower redshifts due to structure formation growing linearly with the scale factor $a$ (neglecting the effect of dark energy).


\begin{equation}
\label{window}
    \tilde{W}(z, f_0)=\frac{f_0}{\rho_c c^2 \bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}(f_0)}
    \frac{R_{BBH}(z)}{(1+z)H(z)} \left. \frac{dE_{GW}}{df_e d\Omega_e}(f_e)\right|_{f_e=(1+z)f_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Images/window_comparison.png}
    \caption[The final window function at 1 Hz for this code for comparison with \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}.]{The final window function at 1 Hz for this code in blue for comparison with \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022} in orange.}
    \label{window_comparison}
\end{figure} 

The window function is normalised using the monopole, which is the same expression integrated over $z$.

\begin{equation}
    \bar{\Omega}_{AGWB}(f_0)= \frac{f_0}{\rho_c}\frac{d\rho_{GW}}{df}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    = \frac{f_0}{\rho_c c^2 } \int \frac{dz}{(1+z)H(z)} R_{BBH}(z) \frac{dE_{GW}}{df_e d\Omega_e}(f_e)
\end{equation}

This can in principle be modified by a detector window function depending on various physical parameters, like mass or inclination angle.

We then Fourier and Legendre transform the GW density contrast to get Legendre polynomials corresponding to multipoles on the sphere.
\begin{equation}
    \delta_X(f_0, \vec{k}) = \int \frac{d^3\vec{x}}{(2\pi)^\frac{3}{2}} 
    \delta_X(f_0, \vec{x}) e^{i\vec{k}\vec{x}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_l(k, f_0) = \int d\phi \int d\mu \mathcal{P}_l(\mu) 
    \delta(\vec{k}, f_0)
\end{equation}

From that, we can calculate the angular power spectrum using the primordial power 
spectrum.

\begin{equation}
    C_l = 4\pi \int \frac{dk}{k} P(k) \Delta_l \Delta_l^*
\end{equation}

Note, that this $\Delta$ is not the same as in equation \ref{window_fct_int}.

In Fig.\ref{window_comparison}, we compare our computed window function with \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}. Our result has a more pronounced peak and decreases quicker with redshift compared to the reference. This is the reason why the angular power spectra are different in the Result Section \ref{results_chapter}. One reason for the difference is likely the fact that we assume merger masses of $20 M_\odot$ for each BH while the reference samples a probability distribution which is more physically accurate.

The window function for different frequencies from 1 to 5000 Hz is plotted in Fig. \ref{window_frequencies}. We see that the peak shifts to lower redshifts when going from 1 Hz up to 500 Hz and then shifts to higher redshifts for frequencies above that. This will also be visible in the final angular power spectra later.


\section{Bias \& Magnification Bias}
\label{bias_section}
If we see GW as a tracer of the underlying dark matter density field, we have to introduce a bias for this tracer, where $\delta$ is again the density contrast.

\begin{equation}
    \delta_{DM}=b_{GW}\delta_{GW}
\end{equation}

\cite{scelfo_gwtimeslss_2018} find this bias to be $1.81$ considering BH from the end-point of stellar evolution (as opposed to primordial BH).

Another bias we consider is the magnification bias. It accounts for gravitational lensing which increases the area of the source and thus decreases the observed number density. Furthermore, fainter objects can reach the magnitude threshold due to gravitational lensing.

If one compares the contributions to $\Delta_l^{\rm{AGWB}}$ between {\tt CLASSgal} and the \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022} paper, the magnification bias has to be  $s=\frac{2}{5}$ for the expressions to match. \cite{bertacca_projection_2020} derive their expressions from first principles without introducing the magnification bias separately and obtain the result of \cite{dallarmi_dipole_2022}.

\section{Evolution Bias}
\label{evo_bias_section}
The evolution bias accounts for the creation of new sources. This is why it depends on the redshift derivative of the merger rate and the energy spectrum of one merger. 
It enters in the projection effects in Section \ref{projection_effects}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Images/evo_bias_test.png}
    \caption{The influence of the evolution bias on the angular power spectrum at an observed frequency of 1000 Hz.}
    \label{evo_bias_plot}
\end{figure} 

We can write this in terms of the logarithmic derivative of the GW energy flux with respect to the scale factor $a$.
\begin{equation}
    b_e(f_0, z) = \frac{d\ln(F)}{d\ln(a)}(f_0, z)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    = -\frac{1+z}{F(f_0, z)}\frac{dF}{dz}(f_0, z)
\end{equation}
The energy flux of GW is a product of the energy spectrum of one binary, using the waveform by \cite{ajith_inspiral-merger-ringdown_2011} and the merger rate of BBH as a function of redshift.
\begin{equation}
    F(f_0, z) = R_{BBH}(z) \frac{d E_{GW}}{df_e d\Omega_e}(f_0, z)
\end{equation}



In Fig. \ref{evo_bias_plot}, we show the computed angular power spectrum with and without the evolution bias. We can see that it barely influences the overall power spectrum. Computationally, it takes much longer to consider it since the merger rate and energy spectrum are computed again at every step. The merger rate for example contains an integral over the halo mass which increases the runtime.
Because of this minor influence, we neglect the evolution when computing the angular power spectra, but it can easily be activated and deactivated in the {\tt Multi\_CLASS} initialisation file ({\tt disable\_gw\_evo\_bias}).

Now that we modelled the window function and the GW, we can calculate the frequency-dependent angular power spectra which will be discussed later in the results section \ref{results_power_spectra}.
